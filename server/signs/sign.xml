    <presentation>PostgreSQL Functions By Example</presentation>

    <Day>Friday</Day>
    <Time-Slot>4:00 PM</Time-Slot>
    <Short-Abstract>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key strengths of PostgreSQL is its extensability, and at the core of that are functions. In PostgreSQL functions can be used as an end in-and-of themselves, or they can be used to allow the creation of other custom SQL objects such as operators and aggregates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation will enlighten the audience on the vast array of capabilities embodied in PostgreSQL functions, and illustrate many of the key features through relatively simple examples.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Day>Friday</Day>
    <Time-Slot>4:00 PM</Time-Slot>
    <Short-Abstract>&lt;p&gt;Unity is the new desktop environment for Ubuntu, having first premiered in version 11.04 and significantly enhanced with version 11.10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Unity offers many usability affordances, some Ubuntu users prefer to customize it for their specific workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux is famous for its customizability, and Unity is no exception if you know which tools to look for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation will use software included with Ubuntu 11.10 and available through the Ubuntu Software Center to show you how to customize the Unity interface.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Day>Sunday</Day>
    <Time-Slot>4:30 PM</Time-Slot>
    <Short-Abstract>&lt;p&gt;With the recent switch to two new desktop environments, Unity and GNOME Shell, a lot of people have been unhappy with the new way of interacting with their desktop. Several attempts have been made to remedy this situation, but those all seem like temporary workarounds.  We will go over the steps to take a default Ubuntu installation, and modify it by installing GNOME Shell and several Extensions that bring back that classic GNOME 2 desktop usability, without losing any of the modern GNOME Shell features.&lt;/p&gt;

    <presentation>Getting involved in open source at a young age</presentation>
    <Room>Catalina D</Room>
    <Day>Saturday</Day>
    <Time-Slot>3:00 PM</Time-Slot>
    <Short-Abstract>&lt;p&gt;Hello, my paper will be on contributing to open source communities when you are of a younger age. I will be speaking about how to contribute by talking about the many ways that you can contribute from both a micro and macro level. Listing things that a younger individual can do to help their favorite projects thrive and know they are making a difference. Such ways that you can contribute would be development, Technical support, and community outreach events. Because kids have more time on their hands they are a good resource for help and are just as good at organizing open source.&lt;/p&gt;

    <presentation>3 Myths and 3 Challenges to Bring System Administration out of the Dark Ages</presentation>
    <Room>La Jolla</Room>
    <Day>Friday</Day>
    <Time-Slot>4:00 PM</Time-Slot>
    <Short-Abstract>&lt;p&gt;Mark Burgess, a provocative thinker about system administration since the 1990s, recently wrote a controversial blog about three ideas that he believes are holding the field of system administration in the past. In this talk he outlines those and chooses three themes everyone should have in mind to accelerate the future of the field: business integration, knowledge management, and emergent design to handle complexity. These are a part of the DevOps movement, but have people really thought through the issues?&lt;/p&gt;

    <Short-Abstract>&lt;p&gt;Stado provides a powerful and flexible analytical environment allowing users to process large amounts of data using a shared-nothing, massively parallel processing (MPP) architecture with PostgreSQL and PostGIS. Data is automatically partitioned across multiple nodes and each node processes its subset of data allowing queries to be distributed across the cluster and run in parallel. This fully open source architecture allows database performance to scale linearly as servers are added to the cluster while appearing as a single database to applications.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Day>Saturday</Day>

    <Short-Abstract>&lt;p&gt;Amazon Web Services is the dominant public cloud provider in the industry.  And for good reason: they make it dead simple to get up and running in the cloud.  Lock-in risks in the public cloud world, though, are enormous: what alternatives will users have if, for whatever reason, they decide that Amazon services are no longer for them?  How do we leverage the freedom of choice provided by open source in a cloud world that is increasingly dominated by a single entity?&lt;/p&gt;

    <Short-Abstract>&lt;p&gt;SmartOS is an open source distribution of illumos, currently in production for Joyent's public cloud, where it provides a hypervisor that is secure, flexible and observable. It leverages technologies such as ZFS snapshots and clones for rapid provisioning, KVM and Zones for hardware and OS virtualization, and DTrace to safely understand what's going on inside of guests and the hypervisor. This talk will describe these technologies and their use, including engineering challenges encountered, and discuss opportunities for observing guests such as Linux and Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Day>Saturday</Day>
    <Time-Slot>11:30 AM</Time-Slot>
    <Short-Abstract>&lt;p&gt;Cloud Computing introduces new challenges for performance analysis, for both customers and operators of the cloud. Apart from monitoring a scaling environment, issues within a system can be complicated when tenants are competing for the same resources, and are invisible to each other. Other factors include rapidly changing production code and wildly unpredictable traffic surges. For performance analysis in the Joyent public cloud, we use a variety of tools including Dynamic Tracing, which allows us to create custom tools and metrics and to explore new concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Short-Abstract>&lt;p&gt;From the start, Eucalyptus has been installed using a set of instructions that walked the user through various options, from distro to hypervisor to network mode. While there is still value in that for the ultimate flexibility, there are other ways to get Eucalyptus installed. FastStart is one such technology. It uses a set of simplifying assumptions to create a POC installer. For those who want to not only provision Eucalyptus, but handle ongoing configuration management, Puppet and Silvereye can help to take things to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Day>Friday</Day>
    <Time-Slot>1:30 PM</Time-Slot>
    <Short-Abstract>&lt;p&gt;Many MySQL users also use the Oracle database and other associated Oracle software. Oracle is integrating MySQL with many of its other software products. The Oracle product certifications and integrations will allow you to use a common set of tools for Oracle and MySQL databases as a data source or as a metadata repository using the same software. Some products have already been integrated, and others are in the works.The products I will cover include Oracle Goldengate, Secure Backup, Audit Vault, OVM, and Firewall as well as some middleware products.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Short-Abstract>&lt;p&gt;Aeolus, an umbrella project for several related open source projects, ties all the cloud resources to which an organization has access together; be they in public or private clouds, into one pool of resources, which can be subdivided into multiple virtual clouds with differing access rights for different users. Aeolus provides tools for managing virtual instances and images across public and private clouds and virtualization management solutions, from image creation to the launch of complex deployments. All fronted by a friendly self-service web application.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Time-Slot>1:30 PM</Time-Slot>
    <Short-Abstract>&lt;p&gt;Explaining open source to someone who barely knows what software is can be hard. Code? Community? It's free? But there's a good chance your software un-savvy friend has heard of Harry Potter. Or World of Goo. Maybe he's a Tron fan. And that's the secret to explaining open source--by using the known as a bridge to the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Short-Abstract>&lt;p&gt;While it is fun to learn how to hack, sometimes it's tough to practice your skills without breaking any laws. It turns out if you have any consumer devices on your local network, you already have everything you need to practice penetration testing. In this talk I will discuss my experience with the Dlink DIR-685 Wireless N router and how with just a few basic skills I was able to find multiple exploits, including one that gave me root, all through the web interface. As I describe the attacks I'll demonstrate the exploits with a live demo.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Time-Slot>11:30 AM</Time-Slot>
    <Short-Abstract>&lt;p&gt;The new generation of web content management systems uses a revision control system such as git, Mercurial, or Perforce, instead of a relational database, for storage. We'll cover systems such as ikiwiki, jekyll, and Perforce Chronicle, and see examples of advanced workflow enabled by revision control--while regular users see a simple wiki-like or WYSIWYG interface. We'll also learn to extend a revision-control-backed WCM system with powerful "PageSpec" expressions or ORM-like Records.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Day>Friday</Day>
    <Time-Slot>11:30 AM</Time-Slot>
    <Short-Abstract>&lt;p&gt;A unique selling point of MySQL is that is supports multiple storage engines, which basically means users get to use the same top-level SQL interface while storing their data in many different sorts of methods. There is a storage engine API that was well nurtured, and a myriad of companies continuing on with creating opensource &amp; commercial storage engines, with the API being extended in forks like MariaDB. Which engine is right for your workload? Do you choose a mix or just stick with something default like MyISAM or InnoDB? This and more will be answered in the talk.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Short-Abstract>&lt;p&gt;Memcached was an original high speed networked key/value store developed by LiveJournal. Over time many new ideas have spring up around the idea of key/value storage: persistence, autoscaling, schemas. The memcached protocol is even used as a side protocol for new versions of MySQL. Recently development has picked up pace, as the project continues to push the envelope for high performance and simplicity. Come hear about the new changes from the project developer also known as Dormando.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Short-Abstract>&lt;p&gt;ROS (Robot Operating System) provides libraries and tools to help software developers create robot applications. It provides hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, visualizers, message-passing, package management, and more. In building ROS we use Linux both as a platform and a model for development. As a platform Linux provides a great development environment and tools in addition to well packaged libraries which are tested and integrated. As a model for development, the open source community built up around Linux is one of the most productive ways to develop.&lt;/p&gt;

System administrators love Chef because it gives them flexibility to integrate all aspects of their infrastructure such as monitoring and trending tools with applications. Software developers love Chef because it helps them take care of the muck so they can focus on writing great applications. Get beyond just configuration management. Investigate Chef's architecture and design including tools and capabilities and dissect the anatomy of a Chef run.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Short-Abstract>&lt;p&gt;Formerly called Ensemble, juju is DevOps DistilledTM. Through the use of charms (renamed from formulas), juju provides you with shareable, re-usable, and repeatable expressions of DevOps best practices. You can use them unmodified, or easily change and connect them to fit your needs. Deploying a charm is similar to installing a package on Ubuntu: ask for it and it’s there; remove it and it’s completely gone.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Short-Abstract>&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing has brought many benefits to enterprises and startups alike. However, one challenge is to determine when a AMI needs to be updated. If you wait too long between new builds, puppet could potentially take upwards of 15-20 minutes to configure new instances to be ready to do their work. Assuming puppet is what's authoritative in your environment, the release of new production puppet code should begin a process of what images need to be updated.&lt;/p&gt;

    <presentation>Automotive: the Next Frontier for Mobile Linux</presentation>
    <Room>Los Angeles A</Room>
    <Day>Saturday</Day>
    <Time-Slot>6:00 PM</Time-Slot>
    <Short-Abstract>&lt;p&gt;Desktop, laptop, phone, tablet . . . car! Which OS will dominate car "in-vehicle infotainment" systems: Windows, Android Linux, WebOS, GNU/Linux or a traditional embedded choice like Angstrom? What are the associated opportunities for app developers and systems programmers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The automotive business model diverges significantly from that of consumer electronics, giving GNU/Linux some advantages over Android. Who are the players in automotive Linux? What are their plans? What reference hardware is suitable for testing car apps? I'll show a simple IVI demo running on an x86 tablet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <presentation>12 Years of FLOSS License Compliance: A Historical Perspective</presentation>
    <Room>Los Angeles B</Room>
    <Day>Saturday</Day>
    <Time-Slot>4:30 PM</Time-Slot>
    <Short-Abstract>&lt;p&gt;Since working on his first GPL enforcement effort in 1999 Kuhn has tracked and followed the state of compliance with the GPL and LGPL. Kuhn will survey the types of FLOSS compliance problems that were and are encountered, and how they have changed historically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much progress has been made since late 1990s, but widespread adoption of BusyBox/Linux and Android/Linux systems has led to more GPL violations than ever before (counting by sheer volume) particularly in embedded products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuhn will discuss how our community can meet these challenges and improve worldwide compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Day>Sunday</Day>
    <Time-Slot>1:30 PM</Time-Slot>
    <Short-Abstract>&lt;p&gt;Free and Open Source software may be largely created and maintained by passionate volunteers, but projects still need funds to pay for things like bandwidth, hardware and the all important tee-shirts. Asking for money is hard – and taking it can be a lot more complicated than you might think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk covers the basics of sourcing financial support for your project. Participants in this session should walk out with the information they need to develop at least the outline of a fund-raising plan for your project.&lt;/p&gt;
